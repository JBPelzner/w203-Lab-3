## Introduction

Understanding what causes crime is an age-long question that is well studied in economic literature. This report aims to contribute to the discussion through an analysis of crime rates of counties in North Carolina in 1987. The data we analyze contains information about crime rates and various socioeconomic, geographic and demographic factors at the county level for 91 of North Carolina's 100 counties.

This study was conducted for the reelection campaign of the Governor of North Carolina. Political consultants have identified crime as a primary voter initiative. Through our analysis we seek to understand how effective increased penalization is at combating crime and how the living conditions within a county affect instances of crime.

In this report, we provide an analysis that illuminates the determinants of crime, and we suggest policy actions that can be implemented at the local government level. The report is structured as follows:

1. First, we check for any holes in the data and clean the dataset accordingly. 2. Next we perform an exploratory analysis of the variables which we reason are the strongest proxies for the concepts we wish to study. This is then followed by fitting a baseline regression model and evaluating all classical linear model assumptions.
3. Then, we fit several more regression models to control for ommitted variables and examine the robustness of the baseline results.
4. Lastly, we generate policy suggestions according to our findings.


## Data Cleaning

Exploration of the dataset for data validity uncovered the following prolems and we took the associated actions. After these changes, the data were vetted and ready for analysis.

* 6 of the original 97 rows have all values missing. We eliminated such rows from the dataset before analysis.
* The `prbconv` variable, representing the ratio of convictions to arrests in a given county was registered as a factor. In repsonse, we cast the probability of conviction column as numeric.
* Examination of the distribution summary table uncovered that all of the data appeared within expected bounds with the exception of `prbarr`, a variable representing the probability of arrest in a given county, because the maximum value belonging to this variable is $>1$, outside the bounds of a probability. To address this we took the following course of action:

\vspace{6pt}

```{r  setup, include = FALSE}
# Dependencies
library("stargazer")
library("car")
library("ggplot2")
library("gridExtra")

# Loading Data
crime <- read.csv('crime_v2.csv')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Exploration:
# Missing value summary
stargazer(is.na(crime))
# Examining missing Values
crime[91:nrow(crime), ]
paste0("Number of missing values in first 92 rows: ", sum(is.na(crime[1:91,])))
# Variales Types Summary
str(crime)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Cleaning changes:

# Omitting NAs
crime <- na.omit(crime)

# Casting factor as numeric
crime$prbconv <- as.numeric(crime$prbconv)

# Removing year and county identifiers
crime <- crime[!names(crime) %in% c('year', 'county')]

# Casting proability of conviction as probability
crime$prbconv <- 1.0/100 * crime$prbconv
```

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=2.75, fig.width=4, fig.cap="Distribution of Probility of Arrest", echo=TRUE}
# Examining outlier in probability of arrest.
ggplot(crime, aes(x=prbarr)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "dodgerblue4") +
  xlab("Probability of Arrest") +
  ylab("Count")
```
\vspace{6pt}

By looking at the histogram of `prbarr`, the variable has one outlier at `r round(max(crime$prbarr), 2)`. This is puzzling because it suggests that the number of convictions in the associated county was greater then the number of arrest in 1987. Some plausible explantions for this apparent outlier include the following:

* The number of convictions includes spillover from pervious years. That is, the number of convictions includes convictions from 1986 and before while the number of arrests only includes arrests from 1987.

* The number of convictions includes spillover from neighoring counties. That is, some criminals were arrested in neighboring counties and tried in the county associated with this outlier, letting the apparent number of convictions exceed the number of arrests.

* The outlier is a mistranscription. The official who reported the figure meant to report `r round(max(crime$prbarr), 2) - 1`.

It while plausile, it is not safe to assume the outlier is a mistranscription, so we stongly speculate that it is a result of spillover either from a different year or a different county, or both. Both cases of spillover suggest that the observation containing this outlier did not come from the underlying population we intend to study: counties which each report their own crime and crime-related information exclusively in the year of 1987. On these grounds, we removed the observation containing this outlier from the analysis.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
crime <- crime[crime$prbarr <= 1.0, ]
```

## Exploratory Analysis

### Variable Selection

In this analysis, we seek to understand the extent to which penalizing criminal activity and living conditions interact with crime. It is necessary to choose variables representing all of the concepts we wish to study. Among all the variables in the dataset we select `crmrte`, representing the number of crimes committed per person in a given county, as the dependent variable used to measure crime. We also select `prbarr`, representing the ratio of offenses to arrests, also known as the probability of arrest, as a proxy for measuring counties' efforts to penalize crime on the street level. 

While there are other variables in the data which can argualy proxy counties' efforts to penalize crime, such as the probability of conviction (after arrest), the probability of imprisonment (after conviction), and the average prison sentence length, we choose probability of arrest because it is the most tangible form of penalty among all those available and the also first to betide an offender. Apprehsion is a county's immediate response to a criminal's offense and is necessary before the criminal can experince any other ensuing forms of penalty. Additionally, because prison sentence is a metric only based on crimes serious enough to warrant imprisonment, it does not reflect a county's effort to penalize all crimes but only the most serious subset of them. Therefore, we consider the probability of arrest to be the strongest proxy for crime penalization that is most likely to deter a criminal from committing an offense. In addition, a higher probability of arrest could indicate that the police are more effective at detaining people who commit crimes in the county.

Moreover, We hypothesize that an increased likelihood of arrest stifes crime rates, because if criminals are less likely to escape punishment after are commiting offenses, we argue that this will make them less inclined to commit the offense in the very first place. 

The variable of interest we identify as most relevant to it's living conditions is `density`, representing the the number of people per square mile in a county. We hypothesize that higher population density leads to an increase in crime rate for two main reasons:

1. In a county with a high population density, there are more vulnerable denizens per square mile for criminals to perpetrate crimes against than there there are in a county with lower density.

2. Prior research suggests that denser areas tend to make people more irritable due to increased economic competition and lack living comfortability, thus making it's people more likely to act out through ciminal behavior.

In summary, the key explanatory variables in our baseline model will be probability of arrest and density. The next figure shows the marginal distributions of crime rate and both key explanatory variables.

\vspace{6pt}

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=3, fig.width=9, fig.cap="Marginal Distributions of Crime Rate, Probability of Arrest and Density", echo=TRUE}
# Crime histogram
plot.crime = ggplot(crime, aes(x=crmrte)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "red3") +
  xlab("Crime Rate") + ylab("Count") + ggtitle("Crime Rate")

# Arrest Probability histogram
plot.arrest = ggplot(crime, aes(x=prbarr)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "dodgerblue4") +
  xlab("Probability of Arrest") + ylab("") + ggtitle("Probability of Arrest")

# Density histogram
plot.density = ggplot(crime, aes(x=density)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "seagreen4") +
  xlab("Density") + ylab("") + ggtitle("Density")

grid.arrange(plot.crime, plot.arrest, plot.density, nrow = 1, ncol = 3)
```

Each distribution has some right skew and a couple outliers, but this is to be expected of complex data.

\vspace{6pt}

### Bivariate Analyses

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Scatter Plots of Crime against Probability of Arrest and Density", echo=FALSE}

p1 <- ggplot(crime, aes(x=prbarr, y=crmrte)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="gam", color = "dodgerblue4", fill = "dodgerblue4") +
  xlab("Probability of Arrest") +
  ylab("Crime Rate") +
  ggtitle("Crime Rate and Probability of Arrest")

p2 <- ggplot(crime, aes(x=density, y=crmrte)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="gam", color = "seagreen4", fill = "seagreen4") +
  xlab("Density") +
  ylab("Crime Rate") +
  ggtitle("Crime Rate and Density")

p3 <- ggplot(crime, aes(x=prbarr, y=log(crmrte))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="gam", color = "dodgerblue4", fill = "dodgerblue4") +
  xlab("Probability of Arrest") +
  ylab("Log-Crime Rate") +
  ggtitle("Log-Crime Rate and Probability of Arrest")

p4 <- ggplot(crime, aes(x=density, y=log(crmrte))) +

  geom_smooth(method="gam", color = "seagreen4", fill = "seagreen4") +
  xlab("Density") +
  ylab("Log-Crime Rate") +
  ggtitle("Log-Crime Rate and Density")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

\vspace{6pt}

The scatter plots above compare the scatter plots of crime rate with each primary explanatory variable and the scatter plots of log-crime rate with the same variables. It appears that the untransformed specifications have the strongest linear relationship with crime rate, so we will specifiy our baseline model without transforming crime rate. Refraining from transforming the response variable will enable us to directly interpret the model coefficients as the associated changes in crime rate for a single unit increase in each explanatory variable.

The first scatter plot illustrates that likelihood of arrest has a negative correlation with crime rate, supporting our hypothesis that increasing crackdown on crime is associated with a lower crime rate. The second plot supports our second hpothesis that increases in popualation density are associated with increased crime rates. 

## Baseline Model Specification. 

$$
crimerate = \beta_0 + \beta_1prbarr + \beta_2density + \epsilon
$$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model.1 <- lm(crmrte ~ prbarr + density, data=crime)
```

\vspace{6pt}

### Assessing CLM Assumptions

1. **Linearity**

> After our bivariate exploratory analyses of crime rate with probability of arrest and crime rate with density, we chose the specification offering relationships that appear linear. However, we can argue that the model is linear no matter what because we have not yet contrained $\epsilon$.

2. **Random Sampling**

> We can infer that because there are 97 data points, out of 100 possible counties in the state, that the researchers intended to complete a census of the population of counties in the state. However, because data from a few counties was inaccessible, they limited the study to a convenience sample of the remaining counties. Since over 5% of the population was sampled, we can not reasonably argue that the data was collected from a random sample. Nonetheless, with over 90% of counties in the state represented, we can conclude that the results of our models will offer useful insights into the causal factors behind crime rate on a statewide level. We assume that the inavailability of data in some counties is not connected to the crime rates therein in any significant way.

3. **Multicollinearity** 

> To test for multicollinearity, we have calculated the inflated variance factors for all of the regressors in the first model. The variance inflation factors for both probability of arrest and density are `r round(car::vif(model.1), 2)` respectively, each of which is close to 1, so there is no problematic multicollinearity and, therefore, no perfect multicollinearity.

4. **Zero Conditional Mean**

> To examine the zero conditional mean assumption, we have plotted the residuals as a function of the fitted values. By inspection of the residuals vs fitted values plot, there is not substantial evidence of violation of the zero conditional mean assumption. The conditional mean remains close to zero but tends downward slightly as the fitted values increase.

5. **Heteroscadascity**

> By examination of the residuals vs fitted values plot, there appears to some degree of heteroscedasticity because the magnitude of the residuals taper off at both the highest and lowest fitted values. To address this, we will use heteroscedasticty robust standard errors when making inferences.

6. **Normality of Errors**

> By inspection of the residuals' normal Q-Q plot and their distribution, the error distribution suffers from a fat right tail and a short left tail. While this means the error distribution deviates from normality somewhat, the sample size of `r nrow(crime)`, which is far greater than 30, enables us to confidently invoke the central limit theorem and conclude that in spite of the errors' non-normality, we approximate the sampling distributions of the model's coefficients.


### Model Results

- discuss that they may be results of OVB

### Assessing Exogeneity

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
response &= \beta_{interest} interest + \beta_{omitted}omitted\\
omitted &= \delta_{interest} interest + ... \\
sign(bias) &=  sign(\beta_{omitted} \times \delta_{interest}) 
\end{aligned}
$$
Endogeneity of density:

* Whether a county is urban
  + Urban localities are known for having crime rates than suburban and rural areas and they are also more dense. Therefore the omission of this variable is likley to have biased the effect of density on crime rate upward from zero. Because `urban` is an indicator variable in the dataset for whether a county is urban, we can control for this omitted variable directly by including urban in subsequent regression models.
* Economic inequality 
  + Economic inequlity is likely to be positively correlated with both crime rate and desnity. Therefore the omission of this variable has most likely inflated the postive effect of density on crime rate. In the absence of a metric for economic disparity such as a gini coefficient, we can mitigate the bias from this omitted variable by including variables descibing other economic conditions, such as the various wage variables and tax per capita variable that are provided in the given dataset.
* Social Cohesion.
  + Social cohesion is likely to be negatively correlated with density. In other words, denser areas may experience higher rates of competition, which can cause distrust and social unrest. In addition, social cohesion is likely to be negatively correlated with crime rate. We expect that the more cohesive a society (county) is, the lower its crime rate will be. Thus, the omission of this variable is likely to have biased the effect of density on crime rate upwards away from zero.  However, metrics for this concepts do not exist in the given dataset. To that end, future work should strive to collect more data on these metrics. Useful metrics could include level of neighbor trust, and rates of  riots, protests, and other forms of social unrest. 
* Geographic region
  + There may be varying levels of crime based on the region in North Carolina in which a county is located. It is difficult to postulate the sign of correlation between region and density, or between region and crime rate, and therefore it is difficult to postulate the direction of the bias from the omission of this variable. Nonetheless, it is a relevant concept which should be controlled for in our analysis. Fortunately, there exists west and central dummy variables, which proxy geographic regions in North Carolina. 
  

Endogeneity of probability of arrest:

* Police presence
  + We speculate that police presence on the street is likely to be negatively correlated with crime rate, but positively correlated with the probability of arrest. This speculation suggests that omitting police presence has inflated the negative effect of the probability of arrest on crime rate by pushing the coefficient away from zero. We can control for police presence by including the police per capital variable in subsequent models.
* Harshness of police force
  + We reason that the harshness of a county's police force is negatively correlated with the crime rate in that county and positively correlated with the probability of arrest in that county. Therefore, omission of this variable from our model would suggest that the effect of probability of arrest on crime rate is biased downwards away from zero. Metrics for this concept do not exist in the given dataset either. Useful metrics could include rate of violent arrests and the degree to which police are armed with weapons. To that end, future work should strive to collect more data on these metrics.  
* Proportion of face-to-face crimes
  + In this context, we are thinking about variety of offenses in the sense that some counties may have a mix of offenses which contain a higher proportion of personal or face-to-face crimes than others. We theorize that the proportion of face-to-face crimes is positively correlated with probability of arrest, because these crimes are generally more serious in nature and could provide victims with descriptions of suspects that can be utilized by the police. Additionally, we reason that proportion of face-to-face crimes is positively correlated with crime rate. Therefore, omission of this variable would lead to the effect of probability of arrest on crime rate being pushed upwards towards zero.


### Future Model Specifications
* To combat the biases that may have arisen from omitting the aforementioned variables, we will proceed by fitting new models with some variables to mitigate these potential biases. After inclusion of additional explanatory regressors, we will evaluate how the effects of the key variables we identified in our basline model have changed and whether or not they are still statistically significant.
* In our first subsequent model iteration, we only include the variables which we believe would contribute the most to a mitigation of omitted variable bias. These variables include the urban indicator variable, `urban`, the police per capita metric variable, `polpc`. We also choose to include the variable `pctymle`
* Then, a following iteration of our model includes controls for geographic fixed effects, utilizing the regional indicator variables `west` and `central`.
* Lastly, a final iteration of our model controls for economic conditions by including wage variables and the tax per capita variable, `taxpc`.

## Regression Summaries
--noting how key explanatory variables remain significant after adding regressors that are proxying for omitted variables
  -- talk about coeffecient effects in the actual units which they represent (e.g. talk about crime rate in terms of crimes per people)

Again, we reference the stargazer table below (Table 1) to display the results of our regression models. After expanding our baseline model, the key findings of this table can be described as follows:

The baseline model exhibits an adjusted R^2 of 0.543. Both key explanatory variables are statistically significant: density is statistically significant at the 0.1% level, and prbarr is statistically significant at the 5% level. According to our baseline model, a 1% increase in density is expected to result in a .008 unit increase in the county’s crime rate, on average. A .8% increase in the county’s crime rate is fairly small in magnitude, and hence we reason this result is not that practically significant. In addition, a 1 unit increase in prbarr is expected to result in a .028 unit decrease in the county’s crime rate, on average. A roughly 3% decrease in the county’s crime rate is fairly noteworthy, and hence we reason this result is practically significant. 

The second model exhibits an adjusted R^2 of 0.594. Both key explanatory variables are statistically significant at the same levels as the baseline model. The standard errors for these variables increased slightly, although these increases are negligible. According to this second model, a 1% increase in density is expected to result in a .006 unit increase in the county’s crime rate, on average. A .6% increase in the county’s crime rate is fairly small in magnitude, and smaller in magnitude compared to our baseline model. Hence we reason this result is not that practically significant. In addition, a 1 unit increase in prbarr is expected to result in a .028 unit decrease in the county’s crime rate, on average. This is consistent with our baseline model, and further confirms our models’ external validity, as well as the practical significance of this particular result. Although the coefficient for polpc is large in magnitude, neither of our additional regressors are statistically significant. We therefore reason that the results associated with these additional regressors are not statistically significant.
The third model exhibits an adjusted R^2 of 0.732. Both key explanatory variables are still statistically significant at the same levels as the baseline model. The standard error for prbarr increased slightly, although the increase is negligible. The standard error for density is equal to that of our second model. In addition, pctymle is statistically significant at the 5% level. According to this third model, a 1% increase in density is expected to result in a .007 unit increase in the county’s crime rate, on average. A .7% increase in the county’s crime rate is fairly small in magnitude, and smaller in magnitude compared to our baseline model. Hence we reason this result is not that practically significant. In addition, a 1 unit increase in prbarr is expected to result in a .036 unit decrease in the county’s crime rate, on average. This result is slightly larger than our baseline model, and could be exaggerated due to the higher standard error associated with this coefficient. Nevertheless, this further confirms our models’ external validity, as well as the practical significance of this particular result. A one unit increase in pctymle is expected to result in a .168 unit increase in the crime rate, on average. A 16.8% increase in the crime rate is considerably large in magnitude. As such, we reason it is practically significant. Besides pctymle, none of the other additional regressors associated with the third model are statistically significant. We therefore reason that the results associated with these additional regressors are not practically significant either.

### Recommendations
We recommend that the governor should collaborate with the state and local governments and their police departments to enact and implement a stop-and-frisk policy. This crime penalization policy would effectively provide police forces with the efficacy to increase the probability of arrest in their jurisdictions. Considering that this dataset provides evidence that a higher probability of arrest is related to a decrease in crime rates, we reason that the Governor can influence crime reduction statewide. Next steps involve consulting state, city, district attorney generals and police chiefs to craft a series of internal policies and bills that will support law enforcement in these efforts as much as possible. The governor should also rally support among statewide and citywide legislatures to ensure these laws can be passed and implemented in a timely fashion. 

We also recommend that the governor fund more youth community building programs throughout the state. This policy is aimed as ameliorating issues associated with social cohesion, living conditions, and economic opportunity.



### Conclusion
This study explores the determinants of crime. Across all three model specifications, we consistently observe that the probability of arrest is both statistically and practically significant in reducing crime rates. We also consistently observe that, to a lesser extent, lower county densities are statistically significant in having reduced crime rates. Interestingly, our third model revealed that the percent of youth males in a county is both statistically and practically significant in having lower crime rates. These results have the potential to inform policy action that can address crime head-on.

Considering the balance between accuracy and parsimony, we reason our baseline model is best for interpretability. Informative for policy action.
